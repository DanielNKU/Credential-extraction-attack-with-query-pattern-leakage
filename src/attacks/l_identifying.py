Module: l_identifying.py

This module implements the L-Identifying Attack as described in the paper's attack model.
The attack is designed to simulate an honest-but-curious C3 server attempting to infer
user credentials based on observed queries submitted by a password manager (PM).

Main class:
    - LIdentifyingAttack

Usage:
    This class supports a streaming-style interface. Query strings are fed into the attack
    one at a time using the `process()` method. Internally, the class maintains state and 
    performs incremental computation as each query is received. At any point, the current 
    result can be retrieved using `get_result()`, and the internal state can be reset using `reset()`.

Example:
    attack = LIdentifyingAttack()
    with open("data/queries_example.txt", "r") as f:
        for line in f:
            attack.process(line.strip())
    result = attack.get_result()
    print(result)

This module is intended to be used as part of a larger simulation and attack framework.
